# AACR-Lexical-Tools
C# app to calculate balance of scores and lexical diversity measurements on datasets of responses.

AACR Lexical Tools was developed to support the AACR research groupâ€™s needs to examine how balanced are scores assigned to categories, in addition to exploring if lexical diversity measurements may inform the development of machine learning models of student responses. 
It was programmed in C# by Marisol Mercado Santiago, a member of the AACR research group, CREATE for STEM Institute, Michigan State University.
The code is open to others to contribute or learn from it.
